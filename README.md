# Thesis: Does Money Matter? Examining the Relationships Between Federal Funding & Population Trends for ESA-Listed Marine Species

## Overview
This repository contains the code, dataset, and final manuscript for my undergraduate thesis, *“Does Money Matter? Examining the Relationships Between Federal Funding & Population Trends for ESA-Listed Marine Species.”* The project explores the relationship between federal funding and population trends for marine species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), using statistical analysis and data science methods.

The key components of this repository include:
- **MarineAnalysis.R**: The R script used for data analysis, including data preprocessing, statistical modeling, and visualizations.
- **Marine.xlsx**: The master dataset containing information on ESA-listed marine species, federal funding, population trends, and related ecological variables.
- **Does Money Matter? Examining the Relationships Between Federal Funding & Population Trends for ESA-Listed Marine Species - Ethan Ignoffo.pdf**: The final thesis manuscript detailing the methodology, results, and conclusions of the analysis.

## Project Structure
- **/code**: Contains the R code used for the thesis analysis.
  - **MarineAnalysis.R**: R script for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
  
- **/dataset**: Contains the master dataset used in the analysis.
  - **Marine.xlsx**: Dataset with funding allocations, population trends, and other relevant variables for ESA-listed marine species.
  
- **/manuscript**: Contains the final written thesis.
  - **Does Money Matter? Examining the Relationships Between Federal Funding & Population Trends for ESA-Listed Marine Species - Ethan Ignoffo.pdf**: The full thesis manuscript with detailed analysis and findings.

## Project Details
This project explores the relationship between federal funding and population trends for ESA-listed marine species, using statistical methods like regression analysis. The work involved:
- Importing and cleaning federal datasets for ESA-listed species.
- Conducting statistical analysis to understand the impact of funding on population recovery trends.
- Visualizing data to interpret trends and provide insights for future policy decisions.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Install dependencies** (if applicable):
   - Ensure you have R installed.
   - Install necessary libraries by running script such as:
     ```r
     install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "lmtest", "car"))
     ```
2. **Run the R Script**:
   - Open `MarineAnalysis.R` in RStudio or another R environment.
   - Run the script to execute the analysis and generate the results.
3. **Review Results**:
   - The output will be shown within R, including visualizations and statistical summaries. You can analyze these results and refer to the thesis manuscript for a detailed discussion.
